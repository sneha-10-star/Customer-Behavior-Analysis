Customer Behavior Analysis | Power BI Portfolio
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Behavioral Analytics for a retail dataset of 10,000+ customers. Unlike standard sales reports, this dashboard deep-dives into how customers interact with the platform, identifying correlations between session engagement, loyalty tiers, and revenue.

🎯 Key Business Questions Addressed:
Does a longer Session Duration actually lead to a higher Order Value?

Which Loyalty Tiers are most at risk of churning based on support tickets?

How do Demographics (Age/Gender) influence spending patterns?
