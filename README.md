Customer Behavior Analysis (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview
This is my second project as a Data Analytics student. The goal of this project was to analyze 10,000 rows of customer data to understand shopping habits and business performance. I used a Dark Mode design to create a modern, professional-looking dashboard.

📊 Business Insights (What I Discovered)
Engagement Patterns: I used a Scatter Plot to show that customers who spend more time on the site (High Session Time) don't always spend more money, helping identify where we can improve sales.

Loyalty Tiers: I analyzed our customer base across four levels: Standard, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

Demographics: I visualized the age and gender distribution to show exactly who our "Typical Customer" is.

Sales Trends: I tracked revenue from 2024 to 2025 to see if the business is growing or shrinking.

🛠️ Skills & Tools
