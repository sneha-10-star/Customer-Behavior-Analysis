Customer Behavior Analysis (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview
This is my second project as a Data Analytics student. I developed this interactive Dark Mode dashboard to analyze a dataset of 10,000 customers. The goal was to move beyond simple sales tracking and explore customer behavior patterns, such as how engagement time relates to spending.

📊 Key Business Insights
Behavioral Mapping: I created a Scatter Plot to visualize the relationship between Session Time and Purchase Amount. This helps identify "high-intent" shoppers vs. "window shoppers."

Loyalty Segmentation: I analyzed the customer base across Membership Tiers (Standard, Silver, Gold, Platinum) to see which group drives the most value.

Demographic Profiling: I visualized Age and Gender data to understand the primary audience for the brand.

Revenue Trends: I tracked performance from 2024 to 2025, identifying key periods of growth and decline.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
Power BI: Data visualization, interactive slicers, and UI design.

Data Formatting: Handled a dataset of 10,000+ records.

UI/UX Design: Implemented a high-contrast Dark Mode theme for a modern, executive feel.

DAX: Used basic Data Analysis Expressions to calculate averages and totals.
